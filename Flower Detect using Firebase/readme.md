# Build Flower Detection iOS app using Firbase hosted tflite model

1. First I had created a Google Colab notebook to train the model and saved the trained model into Google Drive. 
2. Then I had converted the model into .tflite for hosting into Firebase
3. In Firebase console, I had created a project and uploaded tflite model as custom ML Kit
4. Downloaded starter application from Tensorflow github and customized for running inference in Firebase
5. Setup app to run in iOS emulator
